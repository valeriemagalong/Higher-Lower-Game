# Higher-Lower Game

## A web-based number guessing game built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with Bootstrap.

### [Play the game in your browser.](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/valeriemagalong/Higher-Lower-Game/blob/main/higher-lower.html)

This project was crafted at the beginning of my journey into front-end web development.  I aimed to create an interactive, browser-based application that achieves the following objectives:

* Create a simple HTML page.
* Enhance the page design using CSS.
* Use Bootstrap for responsive design and compatibility across different browsers.
* Add functionality and interactive elements with JavaScript.
* Use JavaScript techniques for:
  * manipulating the DOM
  * event handling
  * validating user input
  * remembering guess history (using closure)
