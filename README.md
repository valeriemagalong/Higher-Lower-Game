This project was crafted at the beginning of my web development journey.  I aimed to create an interactive, browser-based application that achieves the following objectives:

* Create a simple HTML page.
* Enhance the page design using CSS.
* Use Bootstrap for responsive design and compatibility across different browsers.
* Add functionality and interactive elements with JavaScript
* Use JavaScript techniques for:
  * Manipulating the DOM
  * Event handling
  * Validating user input
  * Remembering guess history (using closure)
